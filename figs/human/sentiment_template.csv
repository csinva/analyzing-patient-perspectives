39,24,Who do you think should be included in this community consultation process?,"""Other research hospitals. Sometimes when I've gone to the doctor's office, and they're not even affiliated with Children’s, you'll see studies. “NIH is doing a study for blahblahblah.” Like they have that in the you know, in the pediatricians' office so, collaborating with medical other hospitals or just to get the message out that Children’s is. I don't know if that's done, but like maybe coordinating with other similar, you know, health care providers...So just collaborating beyond maybe Children’s. And I don't know whether or not this-'cause you said the ED, so that sounds like you said that primarily, right now, the survey is being conducted with people in the ED? So, the ED just happened to be this time, the Child and Adolescent primary care clinics. Well there, they could have people there during the day, not just in the emergency room but with parents who were coming just for primary care. Because there are studies being done just like that, yeah. So, not just relying on ‘all these families are coming into the ED, let's give them a survey.’ As much as possible while people are seeing providers for other appointments also giving them an opportunity."""

33,2,How do you feel about not having a choice about participation in the study?,"""It's less about not having choice, because I understand that sometimes things need to be done or administered to save a life and they could be unconventional, sure, but this is a study like that's being planned, so there's also time to plan and figure out. Just like you sort of are with the survey, but because like you said everyone who goes into the ER is not necessarily going to be the same people who end up in the ER because like-what I'm saying is, you found me in the ER and so, I happen to be there. But if I had not been there that day, there should still be a way that I understand that it's possible if my child for some reason were to go to Children’s because of a seizure, they could be in this study and sort of just explain that at the very least, that's due diligence...There's a reason why we have informed consent, so as much as is humanly possible and reasonable to get the message out that this is going on in your community and this could be the case. I don't know whether there's an opt in or opt out. I guess not. I don't think that that's as important as just informing the people."""
